👋 Hi, I'm **Betel** – a passionate **Full-Stack Web Developer** based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
💻 I specialize in building robust, scalable, and user-centric applications using **Django**, **React**, **NestJS**, **GraphQL**, and **JavaScript**.

🚀 What I do best:

* Develop efficient and secure **backend systems** with Django & NestJS
* Build responsive and interactive **frontends** with React
* Create and integrate **RESTful and GraphQL APIs**
* Handle real-time features, user authentication, and dynamic content rendering

🛠️ I'm comfortable working across the full stack — from setting up databases to deploying production-ready web apps. I value clean code, thoughtful architecture, and continuous learning.

🌱 Currently exploring advanced patterns in **NestJS** and expanding my skills in **GraphQL**-driven application development.
